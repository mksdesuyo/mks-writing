I’m an undergraduate in computer science at one of the many universities here in Indonesia. I’m also a self-taught guy and love to learn many various things. And I’ve noticed something quite interesting but also quite unfortunate at the same time. Things that I learned in university are nothing compared to the real world. I have a pretty good GPA, but I still struggle to meet the demands in the tech industries.

In order to grow, I’ve been studying here and there, course after course, video after video, and finally landed on these three learning resources that I personally think helped me a lot to improve my skills. The list goes like this:

## 1.Harvard CS50
## 2.The Odin Project
## 3.Frontend Mentor
