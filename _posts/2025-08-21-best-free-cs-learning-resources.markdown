As a computer science undergraduate in Indonesia, I'm also self-taught and love to learn various things. Early on, I noticed an unfortunate gap: the curriculum at university often pales in comparison to the skills needed in the real world. Despite a good GPA, I found myself struggling to meet the demands of the tech industry.

That struggle led me on a journey of self-discovery, exploring countless courses and videos. Along the way, I found a few gems that truly made a difference.

## Three Resources That Changed Me for The Better

Here are the three learning resources that I personally believe were most impactful in leveling up my skills. It goes like:

### 1.[**Harvard CS50**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)
What if you could take the exact same introductory Computer Science class taught at Harvard University, for free, right from your bedroom? That's not a dream; that's **CS50**.

**CS50** is a full-course, taught at Harvard and Yale University that covers algorithms, data structures, web development, and much more. It's freely accessible on Youtube via the **CS50** channel, introducing you to computer science essentials.

### 2.[**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
Full-stack development is still one of the most in-demand fields in tech, and in my opinion, there is no better free resource to master it than **The Odin Project (TOP)**.

Unlike typical video courses, **TOP** operates on a simple but powerful philosophy: you learn by building. This open-source curriculum doesn't just give you the answers; it guides you through building a portfolio of impressive, real-world projects from scratch. You'll learn how to read documentation and solve problems exactly like a professional developer does every day. By the end of the path, you won't just understand conceptsâ€”you'll have the skills and the projects to prove it.
### 3.[**Frontend Mentor**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)
