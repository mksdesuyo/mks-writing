Hello! I'm Rizqi MKS. Let's get a few things out of the way: I'm a master procrastinator, an overthinker, deeply insecure, lazy perfectionist, you name it. I don't enjoy writing, and I rarely finish the books I start.

This blog exists to fight all of that.

It's my personal training ground for discipline. A place to challenge my perfectionism by actually publishing my work. A tool to combat my self-doubt by proving to myself, one post at a time, that I can learn and share something valuable.

This isn't a blog from an expert. It's a log of my ongoing battle to become a better, more consistent learner. Thanks for being here to witness it.
