Hello! I'm Rizqi MKS, a web developer from Garut with a passion for building things—both on and off the screen. My goal is to create clean, efficient solutions, whether it's a front-end or back-end system.

My Core Skillset:
- Front-End: Vue.js
- Back-End: Laravel
- Cloud & IT: AWS Academy (Cloud Foundations & Architecting), Google Cloud Arcade Facilitator, Google IT Support
- Professional: BNSP-Certified Junior Web Developer

I believe growth happens everywhere. Like many others, I constantly wrestle with procrastination, self-doubt, and overthinking. That's why I'm always learning—whether it's mastering new languages like English and Japanese, or pushing my limits through weightlifting and running. Both teach me the same lesson: consistency is the key to overcoming any challenge.

I'm always looking for new challenges and collaborations. This blog is one of them. I hope I can bring value to the table.
